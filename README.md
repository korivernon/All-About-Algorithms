# i_hate_algorithms
This is a repository all about Algorithms and practice. I'm a more hands on learner -- theory isn't my strong suit, so to practice the theory that I learn in class, I like to implement the Algorithmic concepts that I learn.
program.py is a Python Game - similar to Quizlet, but in bash that you can play to brush up on your algorithms knowledge. The Algorithms folder has implementations of Algorithms that I have implemented!

## Possible Improvements?
There are several improvements that can be made:
- Updated Graphical User Interface
- Game Menu
- Native add function so a user can add new terms (or remove them) in the .csv file.
